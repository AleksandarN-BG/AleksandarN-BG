# Zdravo! 👋
## Hey there! 

🎓 I'm Aleksandar, a 3rd year IT student at the [Faculty for Applied Management, Economics and Finance](https://mef.edu.rs/) in Belgrade, Serbia.

🚴 I have experience as a medior support engineer at multiple firms, one specializing in POS systems (we respect ancient MS SQL servers and serial ports in this household) and the other an outsourcing company. Feel free to ask if you're curious!

🌱 Right now, I'm focusing on system administration and architecture, web technologies (RESTful APIs in particular), telephony (PBX systems, SIP, etc...) and networking.

✉️ If you'd like to reach out, feel free to shoot an e-mail over to postmaster@sarifindustries.org!
